# bash-snippets
Bash snippets for me to use for future projects.

[get-latest-version-acs-engine.sh](get-latest-version-acs-engine.sh) - Script I created to download the latest version of the acs-engine from [here](https://github.com/azure/acs-engine) and extract it, used specifically to generate Azure ARM templates for the deployment of Kubernetes into Azure. This script will ultimately be used to inject the acs-engine into a custom VSTS build agent.

[az-cli-snippets](az-cli-snippets.sh) - Azure CLI commands I wanted to capture for future use

[docker-commands.sh](docker-commands.sh) - Docker-related commands I wanted to capture for future use
